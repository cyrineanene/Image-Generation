# Image-Generation
Utilizing pre-trained models to create images from text prompts. 

## Overview
This repository provides a solution for generating images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion, a cutting-edge generative model. 

## About Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is an open-source deep learning model developed by Stability AI, designed for generating detailed images from text descriptions. It uses a diffusion process to iteratively transform random noise into coherent images that match the provided textual input. 

This repository utilizes the model of Stable Diffusion through the Hugging Face implementation.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a Streamlit app `app.py` that allows users to generate images through a simple, interactive graphical interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provides a notebook `StableDiffusion.ipynb` for users who prefer a code-based approach to image generation.
